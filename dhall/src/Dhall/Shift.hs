{-| `shift` is used by both normalization and type-checking to avoid variable
    capture by shifting variable indices

    For example, suppose that you were to normalize the following expression:

> λ(a : Type) → λ(x : a) → (λ(y : a) → λ(x : a) → y) x

    If you were to substitute @y@ with @x@ without shifting any variable
    indices, then you would get the following incorrect result:

> λ(a : Type) → λ(x : a) → λ(x : a) → x  -- Incorrect normalized form

    In order to substitute @x@ in place of @y@ we need to `shift` @x@ by @1@ in
    order to avoid being misinterpreted as the @x@ bound by the innermost
    lambda.  If we perform that `shift` then we get the correct result:

> λ(a : Type) → λ(x : a) → λ(x : a) → x@1

    As a more worked example, suppose that you were to normalize the following
    expression:

>     λ(a : Type)
> →   λ(f : a → a → a)
> →   λ(x : a)
> →   λ(x : a)
> →   (λ(x : a) → f x x@1) x@1

    The correct normalized result would be:

>     λ(a : Type)
> →   λ(f : a → a → a)
> →   λ(x : a)
> →   λ(x : a)
> →   f x@1 x

    The above example illustrates how we need to both increase and decrease
    variable indices as part of substitution:

    * We need to increase the index of the outer @x\@1@ to @x\@2@ before we
      substitute it into the body of the innermost lambda expression in order
      to avoid variable capture.  This substitution changes the body of the
      lambda expression to @(f x\@2 x\@1)@

    * We then remove the innermost lambda and therefore decrease the indices of
      both @x@s in @(f x\@2 x\@1)@ to @(f x\@1 x)@ in order to reflect that one
      less @x@ variable is now bound within that scope

    Formally, @(shift d (V x n) e)@ modifies the expression @e@ by adding @d@ to
    the indices of all variables named @x@ whose indices are greater than
    @(n + m)@, where @m@ is the number of bound variables of the same name
    within that scope

    In practice, @d@ is always @1@ or @-1@ because we either:

    * increment variables by @1@ to avoid variable capture during substitution
    * decrement variables by @1@ when deleting lambdas after substitution

    @n@ starts off at @0@ when substitution begins and increments every time we
    descend into a lambda or let expression that binds a variable of the same
    name in order to avoid shifting the bound variables by mistake.
